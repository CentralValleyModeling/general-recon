Over the next 20 years, California could lose 10 percent of its overall water supplies because of climate change. Delivery capability and reliability of the State Water Project could be reduced as much as 23 percent. The State Water Project (SWP) delivers water to public agencies serving 27 million Californians.  

The SWP's Climate Adaptation Plan describes more than a dozen strategies that the SWP is pursuing to address the effects of climate change. It  quantitatively evaluates five of these to show how they could be expected to change the future of SWP reliability.
