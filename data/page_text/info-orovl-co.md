The September 30 carryover planning target for Lake Oroville is 1.6 MAF. This metric shows the percent of the simulation period (100 years) where Oroville September storage is less than 1.6 MAF. For example, a value of 40% for this metric indicates that in 40 years of the 100 year simulation, the September storage in Oroville is lower than the target of 1.6 MAF.
